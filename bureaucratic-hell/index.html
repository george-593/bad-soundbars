                                <li><strong>1.1 "The Slider":</strong> Refers to the singular graphical user interface
                                    element, typically composed of a linear or circular track and a movable indicator
                                    (the "Knob"), designed for the sole purpose of modulating acoustic energy output.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>1.2 "The Knob":</strong> The digital, intangible, metaphorical, and legally
                                    distinct movable component of "The Slider" which The User manipulates.</li>
                                <li><strong>1.3 "The Act of Sliding":</strong> Any digital interaction, including but
                                    not limited to, clicking, tapping, dragging, or employing keyboard inputs, that
                                    results in the repositioning of "The Knob" upon its designated track.</li>
                                <li><strong>1.4 "Volume":</strong> The perceived and/or actual quantitative level of
                                    auditory output (sound pressure level) emitted from the User's sound-reproducing
                                    hardware (speakers, headphones, etc.).</li>
                                <li><strong>1.5 "Minimum Volume" (0%):</strong> Hereinafter referred to as "The State of
                                    Digital Silence," "The Auditory Void," or "The Abyssal Null-Point." This state
                                    represents the complete, or near-complete, cessation of modulated audio output.</li>
                                <li><strong>1.6 "Maximum Volume" (100%):</strong> Hereinafter referred to as "The Zenith
                                    of Auditory Output," "The Potential Tinnitus Threshold," or "The 'Are You Sure?'
                                    Zone." This state represents the upper-most limit of audio gain controllable by The
                                    Slider, irrespective of hardware limitations.</li>
                                <li><strong>1.7 "Intermediate Values" (1-99%):</strong> The vast, nuanced, and perilous
                                    territory between The Auditory Void and The Zenith. Each percentage point is
                                    considered a unique and legally distinct "Volume State."</li>
                                <li><strong>1.8 "The Company":</strong> The entity providing this Slider, whose
